COMP116 Lab 10 -- Malware Analysis
==================================

1. VirusTotal detection ratio: 40/62
2. Permissions: INTERNET, WAKE\_LOCK, READ\_SMS, RECEIVE\_SMS,
	READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE, WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE, READ\_PHONE\_STATE,
	SEND\_SMS, RECEIVE\_BOOT\_COMPLETED, READ\_CONTACTS,
	ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION, ACCESS\_MOCK\_LOCATION,
	ACCESS\_LOCATION\_EXTRA\_COMMANDS, BIND\_DEVICE\_ADMIN,
	GET\_TASKS, ACCESS\_NETWORK\_STATE

	Without knowing more about what the app is or does, the ability to read
	and receive SMS messages seems a little suspect as does the access to
	external storage, location. "BIND\_DEVICE\_ADMIN" seems too liberal as
	well.
3. Actions are triggered both when the phone sends an SMS message and when the
	phone boots. The Java packages involved are
	".sms.SentReceiver" and "org.merry.core.RunService"
4. There's a suspicious javascript file in raw (bootscriptnet.js).
5. raw/bootscriptnet has the following phone numbers:
	* 1-910-502-0599
	* 4-879-944-9133
6. smali/org/merry/core OnBoot... sms/SentR...
