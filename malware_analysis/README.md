COMP116 Lab 10 -- Malware Analysis
==================================

1. VirusTotal detection ratio: 40/62
2. Permissions: INTERNET, WAKE\_LOCK, READ\_SMS, RECEIVE\_SMS,
	READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE, WRITE\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE, READ\_PHONE\_STATE,
	SEND\_SMS, RECEIVE\_BOOT\_COMPLETED, READ\_CONTACTS,
	ACCESS\_FINE\_LOCATION, ACCESS\_MOCK\_LOCATION,
	ACCESS\_LOCATION\_EXTRA\_COMMANDS, BIND\_DEVICE\_ADMIN,
	GET\_TASKS, ACCESS\_NETWORK\_STATE

	Without knowing more about what the app is or does, the ability to read
	and receive SMS messages seems a little suspect as does the access to
	external storage and location. "BIND\_DEVICE\_ADMIN" potentially gives
	the app admin permissions and doesn't seem necessary either.
3. Actions are triggered both when the phone sends an SMS message and when the
	phone boots. The Java packages involved are
	".sms.SentReceiver" and "org.merry.core.RunService"
4. There's a suspicious javascript file in res/raw (bootscriptnet.js) which
	seems to be communicating with an external source.
5. res/raw/bootscriptnet has the following phone numbers:
	* 1-910-502-0599
	* 4-879-944-9133
6. smali/org/merry/core OnBoot... sms/SentR...

7. URLS:
	* http://23.227.163.110/locker.php
	* http://192.227.137.154/request.php

8. idk
