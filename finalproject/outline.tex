      \item Some specifics about how KRACK was discovered and publicized
    \end{enumerate}
	\item To the Community
		\begin{enumerate}
      \item KRACK is important to talk about because it is recent and many
        systems are likely still vulnerable or people unaware
      \item Disclosure is important not only because of current relevance
        (KRACK) but because this question arises every time a vulnerability is
        discovered and no satisfying conclusion has been reached as to the
        proper way to disclose a vulnerability
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Action/Defense (Technical aspects)
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Technical details of KRACK exploit
      \item How KRACK has and has not been fixed since disclosure
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Non-technical aspects
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Explain how KRACK was disclosed and how this compares to other
        similar vulnerabilities
      \item Compare KRACK to other well-known vulnerabilities and their
        disclosure processes
      \item explore consequences and implications of above
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Conclusion
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Argue for Full Disclosure
