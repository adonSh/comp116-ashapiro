COMP116 Lab 5 -- Python & Scapy
===============================

1. Alarm.py does not detect Nikto scans and live sniffing is iffy. As far as I
	know everything else has been implemented correctly.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
3. I probably spent about 10 hours on this assignment.

Other Questions
---------------
1. Based on the IP addresses alone, it is difficult to draw any sort of
	conclusion. They come from all over, the only pattern that I can see
	being that there are more IP's from more developed countries which is
	pretty meaningless. So I can't say that I'm confident that Russia was
	reponsible based on this information alone.
2. They could be better, but they're mostly functional on basic data. I guess
	they're "just OK".
